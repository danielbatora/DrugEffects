Functions for webscraping to build datasets that link molecular structure and disease indication


This is an initial attempt to come up with a user-friendly python package to webscrape chemical structure - disease indications for predictive and strategic purpuses. 
Currently only curated disease indications are available downloaded from the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database. 
Further work will be done to include inferred data from the database and also protein targets.
